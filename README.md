Created page using HTML CSS and JavaScript

Process/Approach:

My process/approach is still a work in progress. I started out by creating my wireframe to give myself a general idea of what I wanted the finished product to look like. After I had an idea I then created the skeleton of HTML elements as well as adding CSS with different color backgrounds to play around with the layout and get the elements where I wanted them more or less (I did originally start formatting everything desktop first and adding in the according media queries, but it was suggested that I do everything mobile first so i had to reformat early on). As I was doing this my layout started to evolve, I began to put in photos and text as placeholders and rearranging the elements. I also decided at this point to use parallax effects on some of the backgrounds. Once I got the layout settled, I then started working on some of the required elements, putting in the navbar, form, carousel, and pulling info from an API. Slowly but surely I was able to get everything working together and styled t the best of my abilities. As the site became somewhat functional, I then started to replace the placeholders with the real photos and elements that were going to make up the final product. When the real elements were in place I had a little more styling to do to finish off, as well as cleaning up of the excess CSS styling that was repeating its self. Overall I was able to accomplish the objectives but Im not sure the were done in the most efficient ways and my thoughts and process was somewhat unorganized. I have learned a lot through this process and how to be more prepared and organized next time.
